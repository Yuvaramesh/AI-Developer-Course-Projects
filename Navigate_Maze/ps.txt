Title: Hands-on: Training an AI to Navigate a Maze Using Q-Learning
Problem Statement:
Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables AI agents to learn optimal strategies by
interacting with an environment. In this project, we train an AI agent to navigate a maze
using Q-learning, a fundamental RL algorithm. The goal is for the agent to reach the
target (goal) from the starting position while avoiding unnecessary moves. The agent
learns through trial and error, improving its decision-making over multiple episodes.
